# AirPort_RTW88

AirPort_RTW88 is a native macOS AirPort Wi-Fi driver for Realtek RTL88xx PCIe wireless adapters.

It ports the Linux `rtw88` driver to macOS and integrates it with Apple's native AirPort/IO80211 Wi-Fi stack, allowing supported Realtek adapters to appear and operate through the built-in macOS Wi-Fi interface.

AirPort_RTW88 uses the Linux `rtw88` driver as its hardware backend, with macOS integration inspired by and adapted from OpenIntelWireless `itlwm` / `AirportItlwm`.

## Current Status

AirPort_RTW88 1.0.0 provides functional native Wi-Fi connectivity through macOS AirPort.

Currently working:

- Native AirPort/IO80211 interface
- Wi-Fi network scanning
- 2.4 GHz networks
- 5 GHz networks
- Association and connection through the native macOS Wi-Fi interface
- Open networks
- WPA/WPA2 networks
- Native Apple RSN/EAPOL key-management integration
- Normal IP network traffic after association

### Not Currently Supported

- AWDL
- AirDrop and other features that depend on AWDL
- USB Realtek Wi-Fi adapters
- SDIO Realtek Wi-Fi adapters

AWDL support is planned for a future release.

## Supported Hardware

### Tested Hardware

- **RTL8822BE** — tested and confirmed working

### Theoretically Supported Hardware

The following RTL88xx PCIe chipsets are supported by the underlying `rtw88` implementation and their required firmware files are included with AirPort_RTW88:

- **RTL8822CE**
- **RTL8821CE**
- **RTL8812AE**
- **RTL8814AE**

These chipsets have not yet been physically tested with AirPort_RTW88. However, they are expected to work due to their existing `rtw88` support and included firmware.

If you own one of these adapters, testing and feedback are welcome.

> **Note:** USB and SDIO variants are not supported and are not currently planned to be supported.

## Building

AirPort_RTW88 requires:

- Xcode Command Line Tools
- MacKernelSDK
- Linux `rtw88` source

Clone the repository and its submodules:

```sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/xnoah222/Airport_RTW88.git
cd Airport_RTW88
```

If the repository was cloned without `--recursive`:

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

AirPort_RTW88 currently expects the Linux `rtw88` source tree to be located next to the repository.

Clone `rtw88-stable`:

```sh
cd ..
git clone https://github.com/thegwchr/rtw88-stable.git
```

The directory structure should look like:

```text
parent/
├── Airport_RTW88/
└── rtw88-stable/
```

The Linux driver source should therefore be available at:

```text
../rtw88-stable/drivers/net/wireless/realtek/rtw88/
```

If you use a different location, update `LINUX_SRC` in the `Makefile`.

Build AirPort_RTW88 with:

```sh
make airport
```

The resulting kernel extension is:

```text
build/out/AirPort_RTW88.kext
```

## Installation

AirPort_RTW88 is intended primarily for use through OpenCore.

Add:

```text
AirPort_RTW88.kext
```

to your OpenCore `EFI/OC/Kexts` directory and add the corresponding entry to `Kernel -> Add` in `config.plist`.

After rebooting, the Realtek adapter should be exposed to macOS through the native AirPort Wi-Fi interface if initialization succeeds.

For development and debugging, the kext may also be loaded using the appropriate macOS kernel-extension development tools depending on the macOS version and system configuration.

## Troubleshooting

Driver messages can be inspected with:

```sh
log show --last boot --predicate 'process == "kernel"' | grep -Ei 'rtw88|AirportRTW88'
```

For live debugging:

```sh
log stream --predicate 'process == "kernel"' --info | grep -Ei 'rtw88|AirportRTW88'
```

Useful messages include firmware loading, PCI initialization, scanning, association, EAPOL/RSN state and network-interface initialization.

If the adapter is not detected, verify that:

- AirPort_RTW88.kext is actually loaded
- The PCI device is visible to macOS
- The card uses a supported RTL88xx PCIe chipset
- The required firmware is available
- OpenCore is injecting the kext correctly

## Project Structure

AirPort_RTW88 consists of two main layers:

- The ported Linux `rtw88` hardware/PHY/MAC implementation
- The macOS AirPort/IO80211 integration layer

The macOS layer exposes the Realtek hardware as a native Wi-Fi interface instead of presenting it as an Ethernet adapter.

Some internal class names retain the `AirportRTW88` naming used during development.

## Known Limitations

AirPort_RTW88 1.0.0 is the first public release and should still be considered experimental software.

AWDL/P2P functionality is not currently operational. As a result, services that depend on AWDL, such as AirDrop, are not supported in this release.

Support for RTL88xx models other than the RTL8822BE is currently unverified due to lack of physical hardware testing.

## Acknowledgements

AirPort_RTW88 would not be possible without work from several open-source projects and communities:

- **Linux rtw88 contributors** — for the original Realtek RTL88xx driver implementation
- **OpenIntelWireless** — for `itlwm` and `AirportItlwm`, used as important references for macOS Wi-Fi and AirPort integration
- **Acidanthera** — for MacKernelSDK
- **Apple** — for macOS, IO80211 and the surrounding networking frameworks
- **FreeBSD** — for LinuxKPI and its work adapting Linux driver concepts to BSD environments
